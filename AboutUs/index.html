          Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, island country lying in the Indian Ocean
          and separated from peninsular India by the Palk Strait. It is located
          between latitudes 5°55′ and 9°51′ N and longitudes 79°41′ and 81°53′ E
          and has a maximum length of 268 miles (432 km) and a maximum width of
          139 miles (224 km).<br /><br />
          Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural
          interaction between Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a
          crossroads of maritime routes traversing the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka
          has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian
          civilizations. Ancient Greek geographers called it Taprobane. Arabs
          referred to it as Serendib. Later European mapmakers called it Ceylon,
          a name still used occasionally for trade purposes. It officially
          became Sri Lanka in 1972.<br /><br />
          The distinctive civilization of Sri Lanka, with roots that can be
          traced back to the 6th century BCE, is characterized by two factors:
          the preservation of Theravada Buddhism (the orthodox school of
          Buddhism having its literary traditions in the Pali language) and the
          development over two millennia of a sophisticated system of irrigation
          in the drier parts of the country. This civilization was further
          enriched by the influences of Hinduism and Islam.<br /><br />
          In 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule, Sri Lanka became an
          independent country, and it was admitted to the United Nations seven
          years later. The country is a member of the Commonwealth and the South
          Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.<br /><br />
          Colombo, which emerged as the main urban centre during British rule,
          remains the executive and judicial capital of Sri Lanka; Sri
          Jayewardenepura Kotte, a Colombo suburb, is the legislative capital.
          For administrative purposes, the country has been divided into nine
          provinces and subdivided into 25 districts.<br /><br />

        <h2>Land of Sri Lanka</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          A roughly triangular mountainous area known as the Central Highlands
          occupies the south-central region of Sri Lanka and is the heart of the
          country. This highland mass is surrounded by a diverse plain, the
          general elevation of which ranges from sea level to about 1,000 feet
          (300 metres). This plain accounts for about five-sixths of the
          country’s total area.<br /><br />
          The Central Highlands have a highly dissected terrain consisting of a
          unique arrangement of plateaus, ridges, escarpments, intermontane
          basins, and valleys. Sri Lanka’s highest mountains—Pidurutalagala at
          8,281 feet (2,524 metres), Kirigalpotta at 7,858 feet, and Adam’s Peak
          (Sri Pada) at 7,559 feet—are found in this area. The highlands, except
          on their western and southwestern flanks, are sharply defined by a
          series of escarpments, the most spectacular being the so-called
          World’s End, a near-vertical precipice of about 4,000 feet.<br /><br />
          <br />

            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe
          ><br /><br /><br />
          The plain that surrounds the Central Highlands does not have an
          entirely flat and featureless terrain. To the north and northeast of
          the highlands, the plain is traversed by low ridges that decrease in
          altitude as they approach the coast. The western and southwestern
          parts of the plain feature alternating ridges and valleys running
          parallel to the coast and increasing in elevation toward the interior
          to merge imperceptibly with the highland mass. Elsewhere the flatness
          of the plain is sporadically interrupted by rocky buttes and mounds,
          some of which reach elevations of more than 1,000 feet. The plain is
          fringed by a coast consisting mostly of sandy beaches, spits, and
          lagoons. Over a few stretches of the coast there are rocky
          promontories and cliffs, deep-water bays, and offshore islets.<br /><br />
          Geologically, the island of Sri Lanka is considered a southerly
          extension of peninsular India (the Deccan), with which it shares a
          continental shelf and some of its basic lithologic and geomorphic
          characteristics. Hard, crystalline rock formations, such as granite,
          gneisses, khondalite (a type of metamorphic rock), and quartzite, make
          up about nine-tenths of the island’s surface and subsurface.
