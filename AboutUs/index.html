      <div class="dis">
        <p>
          Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, island country lying in the Indian Ocean
          and separated from peninsular India by the Palk Strait. It is located
          between latitudes 5°55′ and 9°51′ N and longitudes 79°41′ and 81°53′ E
          and has a maximum length of 268 miles (432 km) and a maximum width of
          139 miles (224 km).<br /><br />
          Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural
          interaction between Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a
          crossroads of maritime routes traversing the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka
          has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian
          civilizations. Ancient Greek geographers called it Taprobane. Arabs
          referred to it as Serendib. Later European mapmakers called it Ceylon,
          a name still used occasionally for trade purposes. It officially
          became Sri Lanka in 1972.<br /><br />
          The distinctive civilization of Sri Lanka, with roots that can be
          traced back to the 6th century BCE, is characterized by two factors:
          the preservation of Theravada Buddhism (the orthodox school of
          Buddhism having its literary traditions in the Pali language) and the
          development over two millennia of a sophisticated system of irrigation
          in the drier parts of the country. This civilization was further
          enriched by the influences of Hinduism and Islam.<br /><br />
          In 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule, Sri Lanka became an
          independent country, and it was admitted to the United Nations seven
          years later. The country is a member of the Commonwealth and the South
          Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.<br /><br />
          Colombo, which emerged as the main urban centre during British rule,
          remains the executive and judicial capital of Sri Lanka; Sri
          Jayewardenepura Kotte, a Colombo suburb, is the legislative capital.
          For administrative purposes, the country has been divided into nine
          provinces and subdivided into 25 districts.<br /><br />

        <h2>Land of Sri Lanka</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          A roughly triangular mountainous area known as the Central Highlands
          occupies the south-central region of Sri Lanka and is the heart of the
          country. This highland mass is surrounded by a diverse plain, the
          general elevation of which ranges from sea level to about 1,000 feet
          (300 metres). This plain accounts for about five-sixths of the
          country’s total area.<br /><br />
          The Central Highlands have a highly dissected terrain consisting of a
          unique arrangement of plateaus, ridges, escarpments, intermontane
          basins, and valleys. Sri Lanka’s highest mountains—Pidurutalagala at
          8,281 feet (2,524 metres), Kirigalpotta at 7,858 feet, and Adam’s Peak
          (Sri Pada) at 7,559 feet—are found in this area. The highlands, except
          on their western and southwestern flanks, are sharply defined by a
          series of escarpments, the most spectacular being the so-called
          World’s End, a near-vertical precipice of about 4,000 feet.<br /><br />

          ></iframe
          ><br /><br /><br />
          The plain that surrounds the Central Highlands does not have an
          entirely flat and featureless terrain. To the north and northeast of
          the highlands, the plain is traversed by low ridges that decrease in
          altitude as they approach the coast. The western and southwestern
          parts of the plain feature alternating ridges and valleys running
          parallel to the coast and increasing in elevation toward the interior
          to merge imperceptibly with the highland mass. Elsewhere the flatness
          of the plain is sporadically interrupted by rocky buttes and mounds,
          some of which reach elevations of more than 1,000 feet. The plain is
          fringed by a coast consisting mostly of sandy beaches, spits, and
          lagoons. Over a few stretches of the coast there are rocky
          promontories and cliffs, deep-water bays, and offshore islets.<br /><br />
          Geologically, the island of Sri Lanka is considered a southerly
          extension of peninsular India (the Deccan), with which it shares a
          continental shelf and some of its basic lithologic and geomorphic
          characteristics. Hard, crystalline rock formations, such as granite,
          gneisses, khondalite (a type of metamorphic rock), and quartzite, make
          up about nine-tenths of the island’s surface and subsurface.

        <h2>Drainage</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          The surface drainage of Sri Lanka is made up of about 100 “rivers,”
          most of which are mere wet-season rivulets. Twelve major rivers
          account for about 75 percent of the mean annual river discharge of the
          country, with those that flow entirely through the Wet Zone (the
          highlands and the southwestern part of the country; see below)
          carrying about half the total discharge. With the exception of the
          208-mile-long Mahaweli River, all major rivers flow radially from the
          Central Highlands to the sea. The Mahaweli, which originates on the
          western slopes of the highest areas of the highlands, follows a
          circuitous route in its upper reaches before it enters the plain to
          the east of the highlands and then flows toward the northeast coast.
          Because a part of its catchment is well within the Wet Zone, this
          river has a larger and less seasonally varied flow than the other Dry
          Zone rivers and so is a major asset for irrigation in the drier parts
          of the country (the Dry Zone includes the northern part of the country
          and much of the east and southeast; see below).

        <h2>Soils</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          Variations of soil within Sri Lanka reflect the effects of climate,
          lithology, and terrain on the soil-forming processes. The climatic
          influences are reflected in the dominance of red-yellow podzolic soils
          (leached lateritic soils) in the Wet Zone and of reddish brown earths
          (nonlateritic loamy soils) in the Dry Zone. In parts of the Central
          Highlands there are reddish brown latosolic soils (partially laterized
          soils) or immature brown loams (clayey loams). Among the other
          important soil types are the alluvials that occur along the lower
          courses of rivers and the regosols (sandy soils) of the coastal
          tracts.<br /><br />
          Most of the soils of Sri Lanka are potentially suitable for some kind
          of agricultural use. However, depletion of the natural fertility of
          the soil has occurred extensively, especially on the rugged terrain of
          the highlands, owing to poor soil conservation.

        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          Sri Lanka’s tropical location ensures perennially high temperatures,
          with monthly averages between 72 °F (22 °C) and 92 °F (33 °C) in the
          lowlands. In the Central Highlands, higher altitudes account for lower
          temperatures, with monthly averages between 44 °F (7 °C) and 71 °F
          (21.6 °C).<br /><br />
          Rainfall is the conspicuous factor in the seasonal and diurnal
          variations of the climate of Sri Lanka. Most parts of the country
          receive an average annual rainfall of more than 50 inches (1,270 mm).
          However, regional differences in the amount of rain, its seasonality,
          and its variability and effectiveness have formed the basis of a
          distinction in Sri Lanka between a Wet Zone and a Dry Zone. In the
          former area, which covers the southwestern quadrant of the island
          (including the highlands), the rainfall is heavy (annual averages
          range from 98 inches along the coast to more than 150 inches in the
          highlands) and seasonally well distributed (although a greater part of
          the rain comes from the southwest monsoon from May to September).
          Rainfall deviates relatively little each year from the annual averages
          and is effective enough to maintain soil moisture and surface drainage
          throughout the year. Over the rest of the island—the Dry Zone—annual
          totals of rain range from 30 to 70 inches in the different areas (much
          of it being received during the northeast monsoon season from November
          to January). Droughts that persist for more than three months are
          common.

          Sri Lanka’s natural vegetation covers about one-third of the total
          land area. The climax vegetation (i.e., natural vegetation permitted
          to develop uninterrupted) in most parts of the country is forest. In
          the Wet Zone, tropical wet evergreen forest dominates in the lowlands,
          and submontane and montane evergreen forests prevail in the highlands.
          The Dry Zone has a climax vegetation of dry evergreen forest and moist
          deciduous forest, with forests giving way to a stunted, shrubby,
          xerophytic (drought-tolerant) vegetation in its driest parts. In the
          highest areas of the Central Highlands, forests tend to be sparse and
          interspersed with grasslands.<br /><br />
          Most of Sri Lanka’s climax vegetation cover has been heavily depleted
          by extensive clearing of forests for settlements, extraction of
          timber, and agriculture. Only the Sinharaja forest and the Peak
          Wilderness of the southwestern interior remain as significant remnants
          of the Wet Zone’s original evergreen forests. The forests found in
          most parts of the Dry Zone are secondary vegetation, which probably
          developed after hundreds of years of repeated clearing and

          The virgin forests of Sri Lanka are rich in their variety and
          profusion of flora and fauna. Wildlife, including elephants, leopards,
          bears, buffalo, and peafowl, and tree species such as ebony, mahogany,
          satinwood, and teak are being rapidly depleted by indiscriminate
          exploitation.<br /><br />
