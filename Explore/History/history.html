        <p>
          Sri Lanka has had a continuous record of human settlement for more
          than two millennia, and its civilization has been shaped largely by
          that of the Indian subcontinent. The island’s two major ethnic groups,
          the Sinhalese and the Tamils, and its two dominant religions, Buddhism
          and Hinduism, made their way to the island from India, and Indian
          influence pervaded such diverse fields as art, architecture,
          literature, music, medicine, and astronomy.<br /><br />
          Despite its obvious affinities with India, Sri Lanka nevertheless
          developed a unique identity over the ages that ultimately set it apart
          from its neighbour. Cultural traits brought from India necessarily
          underwent independent growth and change in Sri Lanka, owing in part to
          the island’s physical separation from the subcontinent. Buddhism, for
          instance, virtually disappeared from India, but it continued to
          flourish in Sri Lanka, particularly among the Sinhalese. Moreover, the
          Sinhalese language, which grew out of Indo-Aryan dialects from the
          mainland, eventually became indigenous solely to Sri Lanka and
          developed its own literary tradition.<br /><br />
          Also important to Sri Lanka’s cultural development has been its
          position as the nexus of important maritime trade routes between
          Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Long before the European discovery
          of an oceanic route to India in the 15th century, Sri Lanka was known
          to Greek, Roman, Persian, Armenian, Arab, Malay, and Chinese sailors.
          With the coming of the Europeans, however, the strategic importance of
          Sri Lanka increased, and Western maritime powers fought to control its
          shores. Both Sri Lanka and India came under European influence and
          colonial rule. This common experience worked to tighten the
          long-standing links between the two countries, and, with the
          attainment of independence in the mid-20th century, Sri Lankan and
          Indian social institutions and ideologies began to resonate more
          closely with each other.

        <p>
          Geologically, Sri Lanka is an extension of peninsular India that
          separated from the mainland perhaps as recently as the Miocene Epoch
          (roughly 25 to 5 million years ago). Archaeological excavations
          undertaken since the late 20th century have indicated that the island
          already supported human inhabitants some 75,000 to 125,000 years ago.
          The earliest occupants of the region were, like other Paleolithic
          peoples, hunters and gatherers who made and used fairly rough stone
          tools. Finer tools made of quartz and occasionally of chert become
          visible in the archaeological record about 28,000 years ago. The
          artifacts from this era, which include many microliths (very small,
          sharp flakes of stone that can be used individually or hafted together
          to make a serrated edge), have been found throughout the country,
          especially among the grasslands of the hills and the sandy tracts of
          the coast. By about the 9th century BCE, people had begun to
          experiment with food production and irrigation and had gained access
          to some of the iron tools produced on the continent.

          The earliest human settlers in Sri Lanka were likely peoples of the
          proto-Australoid group, perhaps akin to the indigenous hill peoples of
          southern India. Links with peoples from the Southeast Asian
          archipelago also are possible, however. Remnants of these early
          inhabitants were absorbed by the Indo-Aryans—or, more precisely,
          speakers of Indo-Aryan languages—who immigrated from northern India
          about the 5th century BCE and developed into the Sinhalese. The Tamils
          were probably later immigrants from areas of central, eastern, and
          southern India where Dravidian languages were spoken; their early
          migrations spanned a period from about the 3rd century BCE to about
          1200 CE.<br /><br />
          Sri Lanka possesses a historical tradition preserved in written form
          by Buddhist chroniclers. The earliest of the extant chronicles is the
          Dipavamsa (“Island’s Chronicle”), compiled probably by Buddhist nuns
          in the 4th century CE. The Dipavamsa was followed by the Mahavamsa
          (“Great Chronicle”) and its continuation, called the Culavamsa
          (“Little Chronicle”). Together, these chronicles constitute a literary
          record of the establishment and growth of Sinhalese political power
          and of Sri Lankan Buddhism; however, the documents must be used with
          caution and always in conjunction with archaeological—especially
          epigraphic—material.

        <p>
          According to the Sinhalese tradition, as recorded in the Mahavamsa,
          the first Indian settlers on Sri Lanka were Prince Vijaya and his 700
          followers, who landed on the west coast near Puttalam (5th century
          BCE). They had been banished for misconduct from the kingdom of
          Sinhapura in northern India by Vijaya’s father, King Sinhabahu, who
          put them all in a ship and drove them away. When Vijaya’s band landed
          on the island, it was inhabited by yakshas (a type of spirit; perhaps
          referring here to human members of a cult of yaksha devotees), whom
          they defeated and chased into the interior. Vijaya married a yaksha
          princess and had two children by her. Later he drove her and the
          children away and sent to the Madurai court in India for a Pandu
          (probably referring to the Pandya dynasty) princess and for wives for
          his 700 followers. Vijaya settled down to reign as king after a
          ceremonial enthronement and marriage and founded a dynasty. He had no
          heir to the throne, and toward the end of his reign he sent for his
          younger brother at Sinhapura. The brother, unwilling to leave his
          native land, sent his youngest son, Panduvasudeva, to Sri Lanka.
          Panduvasudeva landed with 32 followers at Gokanna (now Trincomalee) on
          the east coast. He was enthroned at Upatissagama and continued the
          Vijaya dynasty.

      <div class="indo-Aryan-settlement">
        <h2>Indo Aryan settlement</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          The account of Sri Lanka’s settlement as presented in the Mahavamsa
          contains an element of historical fact—the settlers were Indo-Aryan
          peoples from northern India. However, controversy exists as to the
          exact provenance of the early settlers; the legends contain evidence
          pointing to both the northeastern and the northwestern parts of the
          Indo-Gangetic Plain. Vijaya’s ancestors hailed from Bengal, in the
          northeast, but his father established himself subsequently in Gujarat,
          the area in northwest India from which the adventurers were put out to
          sea. Before arriving in Sri Lanka, their ship called at Supara, on the
          west coast of India. Their landing in Sri Lanka, at Tambapanni, near
          Puttalam, would indicate their arrival from western India. Some early
          tribal names occurring in Sri Lanka also suggest connections with
          northwestern India and the Indus River region.<br /><br />
          While considerable evidence points to western India as the home of the
          first immigrants, it seems probable that a subsequent wave arrived
          from the vicinity of Bengal and Orissa in the northeast. One band of
          settlers landed in Sri Lanka at the east-coast port of Gokanna, a
          natural port of disembarkation for vessels arriving from the Bay of
          Bengal. The traditional accounts of the arrival of Panduvasudeva may
          portray a second wave of migration following the first mentioned in
          the Vijaya legend. Linguistic affinities between the early Sinhalese-
          and Prakrit-speaking peoples of eastern India strengthen the
          hypothesis of a migration from this area.<br /><br />
          The tradition speaks primarily of settlement by conquest, and tribes
          of conquerors led by a warrior nobility would certainly have propelled
          the Indo-Aryan migration southward. Also important, however, was the
          pursuit of trade (as opposed to military conquest). Indo-Aryan
          merchants probably reached Sri Lanka while sailing down the Indian
          coast, and some of these merchants, motivated by a lucrative trade in
          Sri Lanka’s natural products, may have founded settlements.<br /><br />
          The view that Indo-Aryan migrants laid the foundations of Sinhalese
          civilization increasingly has come into question since the late 20th
          century. Archaeological evidence has indicated that settled
          agriculture, tank irrigation, use of iron, and pottery were features
          present before the Indo-Aryan migrations. During the early phases of
          these migrations, a synthesis seems to have taken place between
          Indo-Aryan, pre-Indo-Aryan, and possibly Dravidian elements to create
          the early Sinhalese culture of the Anuradhapura period, which spanned
          the 3rd century BCE to the 10th century CE. The chronicled account of
          Vijaya’s confrontation with the yakshas and the search for consorts in
          the Pandu kingdom of Madurai (if this may be presumed to be the Pandya
          Tamil kingdom of southern India) point to such integration.<br /><br />
          In any case, Indo-Aryan settlements grew in different parts of the
          island from about the 5th century BCE. The settlers came in numerous
          clans or tribes; the most powerful were the Sinhalese, who eventually
          gave their name to the descendants of the various groups. The earliest
          settlers were those on the west-central coast, who pushed inland along
          the Malwatu River and founded a number of riverbank villages. Their
          seat of government was Upatissagama.<br /><br />
          Tradition attributes the founding of the kingdom of Anuradhapura to
          Pandukkabhaya, the third king of the Vijaya dynasty. With its growth
          as the strongest Sinhalese kingdom, the city of Anuradhapura and the
          nearby settlements flourished. Kings built up the city and developed
          it for urban life as they extended royal control over villages and
          outlying settlements. With the establishment of strong government, the
          population grew and the kingdom expanded into the north-central

        <h2>Conversion to Buddhism</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          According to Sinhalese tradition, Buddhism was first brought to Sri
          Lanka by a mission sent out from eastern India during the reign of the
          Mauryan emperor Ashoka (c. 273–232 BCE). The leader of the mission to
          Sri Lanka, Mahendra (Mahinda), is described as Ashoka’s son. Mahendra
          and his colleagues traveled to the Mihintale hill (the site of some of
          the earliest inscriptions), 8 miles (13 km) from Anuradhapura. There
          they chanced to meet the Sinhalese king Tissa, to whom they delivered
          a sermon on Buddhism. The king was brought into the Buddhist fold, and
          he invited Mahendra and his followers to the city. The missionaries
          were settled in a royal pavilion in the city park of Mahamegha, where
          they preached first to members of the royal family and then to the
          common people. Many embraced the new religion, some taking holy orders
          and joining the Buddhist sangha (community of monks). The king donated
          the Mahamegha park to the sangha. Meanwhile, the monastery of
          Mahavihara was established, and it became the prime centre of Buddhism
          in Sri Lanka. Mahendra sent for his sister Sanghamitta, who arrived
          with a branch of the Bo tree (at Bodh Gaya), under which the Buddha
          had attained enlightenment. The sapling was ceremonially planted in
          the city. Sanghamitta founded an order of nuns, and a stupa (shrine),
          the Thuparamacetiya, was built by the king for popular worship. Thus,
          with the founding of these and other institutions, Buddhism became an
          established religion in Sri Lanka.<br /><br />
          Through the conversion of King Tissa and the missionary activity of
          monks in the villages, by the 2nd century BCE the Sinhalese had
          accepted Buddhism, and this faith helped produce a unity and
          consciousness on which subsequent political and economic strength was
          founded. However, it should be recognized that while the monastic
          chronicles accord the pride of place to Buddhism, other religions also
          were practiced on the island. Jainism, for instance, probably
          represented another major religious tradition, and a Jain monastery is
          mentioned in the Mahavamsa. The chronicle also indicates the presence
          of Brahmans—Hindus of the highest social rank—in Sri Lanka.

          Expansion of Buddhism preceded political unification; many of the
          areas embraced by the new religion were still ruled by a multitude of
          chiefs. The ruler of Anuradhapura, Duttagamani Abhaya (reigned 161–137
          BCE), was preeminent among these chiefs, and, as Buddhism spread, the
          Anuradhapura kingdom extended its political control over the rest of
          Sri Lanka.

        <h2>The Anuradhapura period</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          The Vijaya dynasty of kings continued, with brief interruptions, until
          65 CE, when Vasabha, a member of the Lambakanna royal family, founded
          the Lambakanna dynasty. The Lambakannas ruled for about four
          centuries. Their most noteworthy king was Mahasena (reigned 276–303),
          who constructed many major irrigation systems and championed heterodox
          Buddhist sects.<br /><br />
          A Pandyan invasion from southern India put an end to this dynasty and,
          briefly, to Sinhalese rule in 432. Dhatusena (reigned 459–477)
          defeated the Pandyas and reestablished Sinhalese rule with the line of
          Moriya kings. His son Kashyapa I (reigned 477–495) moved the capital
          from Anuradhapura to the rock fortress of Sigiriya. After Kashyapa’s
          dethronement the capital was returned to Anuradhapura.<br /><br />
          From the 7th century there was an increase in the involvement of south
          Indian powers in the island’s politics and in the presence of Tamil
          mercenaries in and around the capital. Manavamma, a Sinhalese royal
          fugitive, was placed on the throne in 684 with the support of the
          Pallava rulers of south India.<br /><br />
          Manavamma founded the second Lambakanna dynasty, which reigned in
          Anuradhapura for about 400 years. The dynasty produced a number of
          distinguished kings, who consolidated and extended Sinhalese political
          power. During this period, Sinhalese involvement with southern India
          was even closer. Sinhalese kings were drawn into the dynastic battles
          between the Pandyas, Pallavas, and Colas. Invasions from south India
          to Sri Lanka and retaliatory raids were a recurrent phenomenon. In the
          10th century the island’s political and military power weakened
          because of regional particularism and internecine warfare; the
          Colas—hostile because of the Sinhalese alliance with Pandya—attacked
          and occupied the Sinhalese kingdom in 993 and annexed Rajarata (in the
          north-central region of Sri Lanka) as a province of the Cola empire.
          The conquest was completed in 1017, when the Colas seized the southern
          province of Ruhuna.

          The Colas occupied Sri Lanka until 1070, when Vijayabahu liberated the
          island and reestablished Sinhalese power. He shifted the capital
          eastward to Polonnaruwa, a city that was easier to defend against
          south Indian attacks and that controlled the route to Ruhuna. The
          capital remained there for some 150 years. The most colourful king of
          the Polonnaruwa period was Parakramabahu I (reigned 1153–86), under
          whom the kingdom enjoyed its greatest prosperity. He followed a strong
          foreign policy, dispatching a punitive naval expedition to Myanmar
          (Burma) and sending the army to invade the Pandyan kingdom; however,
          these initiatives achieved no permanent success. After Parakramabahu I
          the throne passed to the Kalinga dynasty, and the influence of south
          India increased. Nissankamalla (reigned c. 1186–96) was the last
          effective ruler of this period. The last Polonnaruwa king was Magha
          (reigned 1215–36), an adventurer from south India who seized power and
          ruled with severity

          Kingship was the unifying political institution in the Anuradhapura
          and Polonnaruwa periods, a symbol of the aims and achievements of the
          Sinhalese people. The kingship was essentially Brahmanic (hereditary
          within the priestly social class), with strong Buddhist influences;
          all the kings were practicing Buddhists and patrons of Buddhist
          institutions. The support and blessing of the clergy, moreover, were
          perceived as essential to a peaceful and continuous reign. This
          connection between kingship and Buddhism enabled Buddhism to flourish.
          Kings built, maintained, and endowed many shrines and monasteries, and
          they intervened to establish order and prevent schism within the
          Buddhist community. Nobles and commoners too were lavish in their
          support, and thus Buddhist institutions prospered. Many beautiful
          temples were built with finely carved sculpture, and monasteries
          thrived as centres of learning in the Pali and Sinhalese languages and
          in Buddhist philosophy.<br /><br />
          The king was supported by an inner administrative hierarchy consisting
          of members of his family and influential nobles. The yuvaraja, the
          king’s chosen heir to the throne, was given responsible office. The
          army was the major prop of royal absolutism, and the senapati, or
          commander in chief, was the king’s closest counselor and confidant.<br /><br />
          Sinhalese society was segmented into social classes—castes—each of
          which performed a particular occupation. (The caste system in Sri
          Lanka, however, was not as rigid as its counterpart in India.) The
          Govi, or cultivators, made up the highest caste in Sri Lanka, but many
          other castes also engaged in farming. Administrative officials were
          drawn from the Govi caste, which was stratified into chiefs, titled
          men, and peasants. Chiefs were important supporters of royal
          absolutism and helped administer the government. Nonagricultural
          people, the Hina, were considered of lower rank and were divided into
          occupational groups. These caste groups were endogamous; each lived in
          its own section, along particular streets. Castes were stratified in
          terms of status, with the lowest on the scale—the candala—performing
          the most menial of jobs.
