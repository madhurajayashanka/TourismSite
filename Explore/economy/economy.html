      <div class="economy-dis">
        <p>
          The economy that evolved in Sri Lanka under British rule consisted of
          a modern sector, whose main component was plantation agriculture, and
          a traditional sector comprising subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing
          was an insignificant segment of the economy. Banking and commerce
          were, for the most part, ancillary to plantation agriculture. Nearly
          all foreign earnings were derived from the three staple plantation
          crops—tea, rubber, and coconut. The country depended on imports for
          nearly three-fourths of its food requirements and almost all of its
          manufactured goods.<br /><br />
          During the first three decades after independence, development policy
          focused on two themes, equity through social welfare and substitution
          of imports with local products. Government price subsidies on food,
          statutory price controls on consumer goods, and the provision of free
          education and health services by the government were the principal
          measures guided by equity considerations. Stimulating local production
          to cater to an increasing share of domestic consumption and imposing
          diverse restrictions on imports were the main elements of the import
          substitution policy. The pursuance of these policies required
          increased government intervention in the economy.<br /><br />
          The social welfare policies achieved a measure of success in lowering
          mortality rates and in increasing life expectancy and literacy rates
          to levels seldom matched by other developing countries. However, the
          restrictive impact that the policies had on domestic capital
          accumulation and investment retarded economic growth, leading not only
          to soaring unemployment but also to the persistence of low incomes.
          The achievements of the import substitution policies were even less
          tangible, except perhaps in the production of rice and subsidiary food
          crops. Industry, starved of imported inputs and domestic investment
          and often mismanaged under state control, failed either to grow or to
          achieve acceptable standards of product quality or to remain
          commercially viable. The policy focus on import substitution also
          meant the relative neglect of plantation agriculture, which,
          nevertheless, had to carry a heavy burden of taxation.<br /><br />
          After the late 1970s there was a shift away from the earlier policies
          toward ones aimed at liberalizing the economy from excessive
          government controls. The new policies were designed to accelerate
          economic growth by stimulating private investment and to increase the
          country’s foreign earnings by promoting export-oriented economic
          activities.<br /><br />
          The liberalization policies succeeded initially. Stimulated by a
          substantially enhanced level of foreign aid and investment, the
          economy became buoyant, recording, up to about 1984, real growth rates
          of about 6 percent per annum. Thereafter, however, there was a marked
          deceleration of growth, caused mainly by the disruptive effects of the
          ethnic conflict on economic activity.

          In Sri Lanka the resource potential in minerals such as gemstones,
          graphite, ilmenite, iron ore, limestone, quartz, mica, industrial
          clays, and salt is large. Small but commercially extractable amounts
          of nonferrous metals and minerals like titanium, monazite, and zircon
          are contained in the beach sands of a few localities. Of fossil fuels,
          the only known resource is the low-grade peat found in a swampy
          stretch along the west coast.

          Rice production is the most important economic activity of Sri Lanka’s
          peasantry. Since independence there has been an impressive increase of
          paddy production. The factors that contributed to this were, first,
          the opening of 248,000 acres for paddy in the colonization schemes of
          the Dry Zone (including those of the Mahaweli Development Program
          launched in the early 1970s) and, second, the adoption of
          yield-increasing technology. Other important changes in peasant
          agriculture during postindependence times included diversification of
          production as well as increased commercialization of production
          transactions.<br /><br />
          In terms of product value, contribution to export earnings, and the
          size of the work force, plantation agriculture has continued to figure
          prominently in the economy of Sri Lanka; however, its long-term trend
          has been one of relative decline.<br /><br />
          Tea, the preeminent crop of the plantation sector, grows in many parts
          of the Wet Zone. Crops that are concentrated at higher altitudes
          supply some of the best-quality black teas to the world market. The
          main rubber-growing area is the ridge-and-valley country of the Wet
          Zone interior. Coconut is grown mainly in the hinterland of the
          western seaboard.<br /><br />
          Plantations represent a segment of the economy that has failed to make
          significant advances since the time of independence. This is largely
          attributable to the persistently low rates of investment in this
          sector. Sri Lanka’s land reforms of 1972–75, through which the
          government acquired the ownership of about 60 percent of the total tea
          acreage and 30 percent of the rubber acreage, also contributed to the
          decline in productivity and commercial viability of the plantation
          sector.<br /><br />
          Forestry and fishing are relatively insignificant components of the
          economy. Forests had been cleared for settlement and agriculture at an
          estimated rate of 104,000 acres annually between 1956 and 1981.
          Extraction of timber and fuelwood from forests is constrained by
          environmental conservation. In fisheries, the resource potential is
          abundant, particularly on the north and northwest coasts. Constraints
          on development are largely technological. Fishing, however, is an
          important occupation for the people living along the coastal fringe.

        <p>
          Sri Lanka’s mineral-extraction industries include mining of gemstones
          and graphite; excavation of beach sands containing ilmenite and
          monazite; and quarrying kaolin, apatite, quartz sand, clay, and salt.
          Among them, gem mining is the most important, producing high-value
          gemstones such as sapphire, ruby, and topaz, in addition to a variety
          of semiprecious stones, most of which reach foreign markets. Graphite,
          ilmenite, and monazite, exported in semiprocessed form, contribute on
          a small scale to Sri Lanka’s foreign earnings. The other minerals are
          used locally as raw materials in the manufacturing and construction
          industries.<br /><br />
          Until the late 1970s, manufacturing in Sri Lanka was dominated by
          several large-scale enterprises developed within the state sector to
          produce goods such as cement, fabricated steel, ceramics, fuel and
          lubricant oils, paper, leather, tires, textiles, sugar, and liquor.
          Only a few factory-based industries, most of them producing light
          consumer goods, were in private hands.<br /><br />
          The liberalization policies adopted in 1977 brought significant
          changes. Some state-owned industrial enterprises were privatized.
          Fiscal and other concessions were offered to prospective private
          investors, particularly to attract foreign investments. These included
          a package of incentives provided at several investment promotion
          zones. The low wage rates prevalent in the country were an added
          attraction to the industrial ventures that responded to these
          incentives. By the early 1990s new industries employed a work force of
          more than 70,000 and had nearly equaled tea in gross export earnings.
          Many of them, however, depend on imported inputs and involve
          considerable repatriation of profits. Hence, they generate relatively
          low net returns to the economy.<br /><br />
          Among the industries that flourished under the liberalization policies
          was tourism, which, however, remains highly sensitive to political
          instability. The expansion of tourism, along with the massive
          irrigation and housing projects undertaken since 1978, have
          contributed substantially to the growth of the construction
          industry.<br /><br />
          The rivers that cascade down the Central Highlands offer prospects for
          hydropower development. Some of it is being harnessed at large power
          stations, including those established under the Mahaweli Development
          Program. Hydropower provides nearly three-fourths of the country’s
          electricity supply. Imported crude oil is being converted to gasoline
          and other petroleum products at the state-owned refinery. Some of
          these products are reexported. Fuelwood continues to be the major
          source of energy in rural areas.

          Banking and the issue of currency are controlled by the Central Bank
          of Sri Lanka. Until the late 1970s, commercial banking was the
          near-exclusive monopoly of two state-run banks, the Bank of Ceylon and
          the People’s Bank. The postliberalization period allowed the
          establishment of several private commercial banks and an overall
          expansion in banking, particularly with the government’s decision in
          1979 to allow foreign banks to open branches in Sri Lanka. These same
          trends were replicated in other spheres of commerce such as insurance
          and wholesale trade in imported goods. The increased participation of
          the private sector in industry and commerce led to the emergence of a
          small but vibrant stock market in Colombo.

          Changes in agriculture and industry brought about a decline in the
          relative importance of plantation products among the exports and of
          food commodities among the imports. This, however, has not reduced the
          adverse balance in foreign trade from which the economy continues to
          suffer. Much of the trade deficit results from transactions with the
          industrialized countries of Asia, including India, China, and Japan,
          from which imported manufactured goods originate. Singapore and the
          United Arab Emirates are also major sources of imports. The United
          States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany are all important
          export destinations.

          Road and rail transport accounts for an overwhelmingly large share of
          the movement of people and commodities within Sri Lanka. In rail
          transport the government holds a monopoly. Passenger transport by road
          is shared by the government and the private sector. The private
          automobile remains a luxury that only the affluent can afford. The
          bicycle and the bullock cart are important modes of conveyance,
          especially in rual areas.<br /><br />
          SriLankan Airlines (formerly Air Lanka), the national airline,
          operates regularly between its base at Colombo and dozens of major
          cities in Asia, Europe, and North America. The seaport of Colombo
          handles the bulk of Sri Lanka’s shipping, including some
          transshipments of the Indian ports. International cargo is also
          handled by the ports at Trincomalee and Galle.
