        <h2>Constitutional Framework</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          A representative, democratic system of government has existed in Sri
          Lanka since the termination of British rule in 1948. Elections are
          regularly held, and citizens over 18 years of age may vote. Fairly
          contested elections have resulted in several orderly changes of
          government since independence.<br /><br />
          As provided for by the constitution of 1978, the government is headed
          by an executive president elected directly by popular vote from a
          national electorate. The president selects a cabinet of ministers and
          other noncabinet ministers from the parliament. The president is also
          the commander in chief of the armed forces—army, navy, and air
          force.<br /><br />
          The national parliament consists of more than 200 members. The system
          of proportional representation that operates at the elections ensures
          that the number of parliamentary seats secured by each party is
          roughly proportional to the number of votes received by the party at
          the polls.<br /><br />
          Sri Lanka’s constitution provides for certain functions of government
          to be devolved to provincial councils (palāth sabhā). In addition, the
          country has a system of local government comprising municipal councils
          and urban councils.

          The independence of Sri Lanka’s judiciary is protected by the
          constitution. The Supreme Court is the highest appellate court and the
          final arbiter in constitutional disputes. The Court of Appeal, High
          Court, district courts, magistrate’s courts, and primary courts
          occupy, successively, the lower levels of the hierarchy. The common
          law of Sri Lanka is based largely on Roman-Dutch law. Principles drawn
          from indigenous legal traditions are applied to aspects of civil law
          concerning certain communities.

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          Among the political parties in Sri Lanka, the conservative United
          National Party (UNP) and the more liberal Sri Lanka Freedom Party
          (SLFP) have dominated the political arena since independence. A
          splinter party from the SLFP, known as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna
          party (SLPP), emerged as a political force after parliament member and
          former president Mahinda Rajapaksa joined the party in 2018.
          Successive governments have been led by one of these parties, which,
          at times, formed coalitions with the smaller parties.

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          The government controls the educational system and offers free
          education from primary schools through university levels and in
          certain professional and technical fields. The country has a
          relatively well-developed system of primary and secondary education
          with high rates of student enrollment in most parts of the country.
          More than 85 percent of the population is literate, giving Sir Lanka
          one of the highest literacy rates among developing countries. Tertiary
          education (including universities), however, caters to only the small
          proportion that completed secondary education. Formal higher education
          in the country has a strong academic bias, making the large majority
          of university graduates suitable for only a limited number of
          white-collar jobs; this has caused widespread frustration, especially
          among the educated unemployed youth. Major universities include the
          University of Ruhuna (1978); the University of Jaffna (1974); and the
          University of Kelaniya and the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, both
          of which were centres of Buddhist learning until they were elevated to
          university status in 1959.

        <p>
          In Sri Lanka, government-sponsored health services are free and are
          delivered through an extensive network of hospitals and dispensaries.
          Several special campaigns in preventive health care, and a program of
          family planning—all based on Western medical technology—have
          significantly improved health conditions in Sri Lanka. These services
          coexist with a smaller private sector in Western medicine. Several
          indigenous traditions of curative health care, some of which receive
          government sponsorship, remain largely in the private sector but play
          an important role in Sri Lankan medical practices. Practitioners of
          traditional medicine (ayurveda) outnumber Western-trained physicians.
          Major health problems include malnutrition and various
          gastrointestinal infectious diseases.
